Simple Tasks Management project in laravel 12, mysql and bootstrap 5
=====================================================================
- Create task (info to save: task name, priority, timestamps)
- Edit task
- Delete task
- Reorder tasks with drag and drop in the browser. Priority should automatically be updated based on this. #1 priority goes at top, #2 next down and so on.
- Tasks should be saved to a mysql table.
- Add project functionality to the tasks. User should be able to select a project from a dropdown and only view tasks associated with that project.
